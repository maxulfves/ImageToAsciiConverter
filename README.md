# ImageToAsciiConverter
A program that converts image files to ASCII text. 

# To build
- Open project with QT creator

# How to use
- Press the button "Upload file..." to select your image-file. 
- Select appropriate clipping-values for your project. 
- Click on "Convert" to output the ASCII-text. 

# Left to do
- Only works correctly for portrait images
- Add more functionality for mapping colors
- Use a rounded value when raytracing the image. Currently only uses every n:th pixel, which loses detail.
